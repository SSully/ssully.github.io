                As the title says, my name is Sean Sullivan. I am studying Computer Science and Information Security at Lewis University. I really adore my school; the teachers here are simply incredible and the courses available seem to be getting better every year. Currently, in my robotics class, we are 3D printing the open source <a href='http://inmoov.blogspot.com/'>InMoov robot</a>. We are just finishing up the arm assembly and it's cooler than I ever imagined. Although I currently lack the time and money, I hope to invest in a 3D printer someday so I can try and complete the full build in my own time.

                Outside of school I work at Argonne National Laboratory as a Co-Op Web Developer. I started working at Argonne in May of 2012 and it has been a life changing opportunity. Here I work with some of the best people in the world who have given me countless opportunities to expand my skills. During my time at Arognne I have built multiple web applications from the ground up that are used by numerous employees throughout the lab.

                Through all of this madness, I have the support of a wonderful family, an Irish Terrier named Bear, and my girlfriend Gina. In my free time I collect vinyl records, mess around on guitar, and play video games. If you ever need someone to play DOTA 2 with, I am your guy.

                If you have any questions about what I do, need help with anything, or just want to chat feel free to send me an email.
